Task Forces operate under specific Working Groups.

This page lists some active Task Forces in [WAI Working Groups](/about/groups/). Other Task Forces, including inactive
ones, are listed on each Working Group's home page.

**[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/)** under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Develop a framework and repository of test rules, to promote a
    unified interpretation of WCAG 2.0 among different web accessibility
    test tools. The framework will also allow the development of custom
    test rules to meet company requirements and best practices. While
    this framework will add a layer of implemention for tool developers,
    it provides more consistency and comparability of the resulting test
    rules.
    
**[ARIA Authoring Practices Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/)** under the [ARIA Working Group](about/groups/ariawg)
:   Develop WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG), which describes considerations that might 
    not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification  alone and recommends 
    approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles,
    states, and properties.    

**[Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/coga/)** (Cognitive A11Y TF) under the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/) and the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Assisting Working Groups to produce techniques, understanding, and
    guidance documents, as well as updates to existing related W3C
    material that addresses the cognitive space.

**[Low Vision Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/low-vision-a11y-tf/)** (LVTF) under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Assisting Working Groups to address web accessibility issues
    specific to people with low vision.

**[Mobile Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/matf/)** under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Assisting Working Groups to produce techniques, understanding, and
    guidance documents, as well as updates to existing related W3C
    material that addresses the mobile space.

**[Research Question Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/research-questions/)** under the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/)
:   Identify accessibility knowledge gaps and barriers in emerging and
    future web technologies, and to identify research findings,
    researchers, and research opportunities to inform and fill those
    gaps where possible.

**[Silver Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/silver/)** under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Perform preliminary development of a new version of Accessibility
    Guidelines following a research-focused, user-centered design
    methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome.
    These guidelines will address the process of making content and
    functionality accessible to people with disabilities, including the
    roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool
    support. These guidelines will address current technological and
    cultural web accessibility requirements and provide a base for
    continued evolution of the guidelines.
    
**[Spoken Pronunciation Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/pronunciation/)** under the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/)
:   The Spoken Pronunciation Task Force has been exploring technical options for content authors to provide pronunciation information.

**[WAI-Adapt Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/personalization/)** under the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/)
:   WAI-Adapt specifications enable users to personalize how content is presented in order to meet their needs and preferences.

**[WCAG2ICT Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2ict/)** under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   The WCAG2ICT Task Force develops documentation 
    describing how WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, and success 
    criteria could apply to non-Web Information and Communications 
    Technologies (ICT).
